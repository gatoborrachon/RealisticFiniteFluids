## Realistic Finite Fluids
A mod about finite water and lava with realistic movement


**Note**: If you want to load the game inside the dev environment, you will need to set the variable _onDev_ to true (inside References.java)
if you want to build a jar, you will need to set it to false

Even if it gives you an error, you will have your .jar inside build\libs
